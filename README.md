# Purpose of repo:
I'm creating this repo to store my assignments for Stats507.
# Purpose of the code:
The PS2Q3 code is about importing the NHANES data, and some data cleaning.
For example, I inserted the columns indicating data from different cohorts and changed the variable names to readable format.
